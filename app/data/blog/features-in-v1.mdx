## Overview

A post on the features in v1.0:

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

{/* <TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure /> */}

## Theme colors

You can easily modify the theme color by changing the primary attribute in the tailwind config file:

```:tailwind.config.js
theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: colors.teal,
      gray: colors.neutral,
      ...
    }
  ...
}
```

The primary color attribute should be assigned an object with keys from 50, 100, 200 ... 900 and the corresponding color code values.

Tailwind includes great default color palettes that can be used for theming your own website. Check out [customizing colors documentation page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for the full range of options.

## Xdm MDX compiler

We use [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) which uses [xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) under the hood, the latest micromark 3 and remark, rehype libraries.

This allows loading components directly in the mdx file using the import syntax and including js code which could be compiled and bundled at the build step.

For example, the following jsx snippet can be used directly in an MDX file to render the page title component:

```jsx
import PageTitle from "./PageTitle.js";
<PageTitle> Using JSX components in MDX </PageTitle>;
```

import PageTitle from "./PageTitle.js";

<PageTitle> Using JSX components in MDX </PageTitle>

The default configuration resolves all components relative to the `components` directory.

## Table of contents component

Inspired by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc) and Gatsby's [gatsby-remark-table-of-contents](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents/),
the `toc` variable containing all the top level headings of the document is passed to the MDX file and can be styled accordingly.
To make generating a table of contents (TOC) simple, you can use the existing `TOCInline` component.

For example, the TOC in this post was generated with the following code:

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />
```

You can customise the headings that are displayed by configuring the `fromHeading` and `toHeading` props, or exclude particular headings
by passing a string or a string array to the `exclude` prop. By default, all headings that are of depth 3 or smaller are indented. This can be configured by changing the `indentDepth` property.
A `asDisclosure` prop can be used to render the TOC within an expandable disclosure element.

Here's the full TOC rendered in a disclosure element.

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />
```

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

## Layouts

You can map mdx blog content to layout components by configuring the frontmatter field. For example, this post is written with the `PostSimple` layout!

### Adding new templates

layout templates are stored in the `./layouts` folder. You can add your React components that you want to map to markdown content in this folder.
The component file name must match that specified in the markdown frontmatter `layout` field.

The only required field is `children` which contains the rendered MDX content, though you'll want to pass in the frontMatter contents and render it in the template.

Here's an example layout which you can further customise:

```jsx
export default function ExampleLayout({ frontMatter, children }) {
  const { date, title } = frontMatter;

  return (
    <SectionContainer>
      <div>{date}</div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </SectionContainer>
  );
}
```

### Configuring a blog post frontmatter

Use the `layout` frontmatter field to specify the template you want to map the markdown post to. Here's how the frontmatter of this post looks like:

```
---
title: 'New features in v1'
date: '2021-05-26   '
tags: ['remix-run', 'tailwind', 'guide']
draft: false
summary: 'Introducing the new layout features - you can map mdx blog content to layout components by configuring the frontmatter field'
layout: PostSimpleLayout
---
```

You can configure the default layout in the respective page section by modifying the `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` variable.
The `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` for blog posts page is set to `PostSimpleLayout`.

### Extend

`layout` is mapped to wrapper which wraps the entire MDX content.

I do have a rather ugly switch statment in the `MDXComponents.tsx` so each time you add a new layout template you must add it to the switch statment.

```jsx
switch (layout) {
  case "PostSimpleLayout":
    return <PostSimpleLayout children={children} {...rest} />;
  case "AuthorLayout":
    return <AuthorLayout children={children} {...rest} />;
  case "ExampleLayout":
    return <ExampleLayout children={children} {...rest} />;
}
```

I have struggled with adding dynamic `require` in Remix as shown below so for now the `switch` statement above is all I have.

```jsx
const Layout = (await import(`~/app/layouts/${layout}`)) as any;
return <Layout {...rest} />;
```

Use the `MDXLayoutRenderer` component on a page where you want to accept a layout name to map to the desired layout. You need to pass the layout name from the layout folder (it has to be an exact match).

```jsx
export const MDXLayoutRenderer = ({ layout, mdxSource, ...rest }) => {
  const MDXLayout = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(mdxSource), [mdxSource]);

  return <MDXLayout layout={layout} components={MDXComponents} {...rest} />;
};
```

## Copy button for code blocks

Hover over a code block and you will notice a GitHub-inspired copy button! You can modify `./components/Pre.js` to further customise it.
The component is passed to `MDXComponents` and modifies all `<pre>` blocks.

## Line highlighting and line numbers

Line highlighting and line numbers are now supported out of the box thanks to the new [rehype-prism-plus plugin](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus)

The following javascript code block:

````
```js:showLineNumbers {1, 3-4}
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```
````

will appear as:

```js:showLineNumbers {1, 3-4}
var num1, num2, sum;
num1 = prompt("Enter first number");
num2 = prompt("Enter second number");
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2); // "+" means "add"
alert("Sum = " + sum); // "+" means combine into a string
```

To modify the styles, change the following class selectors in the `prism.css` file:

```css
.code-highlight {
  @apply float-left min-w-full;
}

.code-line {
  @apply -mx-4 block border-l-4 border-opacity-0 pl-4 pr-4;
}

.code-line.inserted {
  @apply bg-green-500 bg-opacity-20;
}

.code-line.deleted {
  @apply bg-red-500 bg-opacity-20;
}

.highlight-line {
  @apply -mx-4 border-l-4 border-primary-500 bg-gray-700 bg-opacity-50;
}

.line-number::before {
  @apply -ml-2 mr-4 inline-block w-4 text-right text-gray-400;
  content: attr(line);
}
```

## Bibliography and Citations

`rehype-citation` plugin is added to the xdm processing pipeline. This allows you to easily format citations and insert bibliography from an existing bibtex or CSL-json file.

For example, the following markdown code sample:

```md
Standard citation [@Nash1950]
In-text citations e.g. @Nash1951
Multiple citations [see @Nash1950; @Nash1951, page 50]

**References:**

[^ref]
```

is rendered to the following:

Standard citation [@Nash1950]  
In-text citations e.g. @Nash1951  
Multiple citations [see @Nash1950; @Nash1951, page 50]

**References:**

[^ref]

A bibliography will be inserted at the end of the document, but this can be overwritten by specifying a `[^Ref]` tag at the intended location.
The plugin uses APA citation formation, but also supports the following CSLs, 'apa', 'vancouver', 'harvard1', 'chicago', 'mla', or a path to a user-specified CSL file.

See [rehype-citation readme](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-citation) for more information on the configuration options.
